# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of Project
Kate and I have been working to prepare a business proposal to start a bike-share business in Des Moines. We used data provided by Citi-Bike (INSERT LINK - https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) to research how their business works in New York City so we could work to model ours in a similar fashion. If we can learn how the business is successful in New York, that would help us better understand what changes we would need to make to have a successful business here.

### Checkout Times by Users
![Chart1](https://github.com/MeredithTracy/Bikesharing_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Chart1.png)

This chart shows the number of rides(bikes) and the trip duration of the ride. The chart shows that a majority of the rides lasted under one hour. 

### Checkout Times by Gender
![Chart2](https://github.com/MeredithTracy/Bikesharing_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Chart2.png)

This chart shows the breakdown of the number of rides(bikes) and trip duration grouped by gender. We can see that it is fairly consistent between male and female. The difference in height between the two is because we have more data for male riders, which is further described in the Gender Breakdown chart below. 

### Trips by Weekday per Hour
![Chart3](https://github.com/MeredithTracy/Bikesharing_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Chart3.png)

Our heatmap chart shows when there are spikes in rides during each day of the week by hour. We can see that there are trends in the early morning and early evening. This corresponds with work commute times. There are also general spikes on the weekends during the day. 

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
![Chart4](https://github.com/MeredithTracy/Bikesharing_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Chart4.png)

Similar to the chart above, this heatmap shows the trends in ride times based on gender. We can see they are fairly consistent. The Male chart appears darker which is explained by there being more data for male riders. 

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
![Chart5](https://github.com/MeredithTracy/Bikesharing_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Chart5.png)

This heatmap shows the breakdown on rides by weekday and gender but sorted by customers versus subscribers. This chart shows us that a majority of these rides were done by subscribers overall. We can see that Thursdays in particular are busy days for both genders in the subscriber category. 

### Gender Breakdown
![Chart6](https://github.com/MeredithTracy/Bikesharing_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Chart6.png)

This simple pie chart breaks down our data by gender. We can see that well over half our data are from male riders. This explains why there is a larger spike or hot spots for males across the board. 

### Customer Type
![Chart7](https://github.com/MeredithTracy/Bikesharing_Analysis/blob/main/Images/Chart7.png)

Our last chart marks the breakdown of customers versus subscribers. We can see that the vast majority of Citi Bike users in New York City are subscribers. This likely means that people within the community use these bikes to get around somewhat regularly. 

## Summary 
Overall, we can see that Citi Bike is a highly used program in New York. Based on trends in ride times, we can see that it is used by commuters around the city. We could also provide stations around tourist heavy locations for weekend rides for tourists. Gender did not seem to play much into duration of trips but based on this data, it appears males may be more likely to use this service. The customer breakdown chart shows that we could build a subscriber base who would use the bikes regularly which would be great both for income and marketing. 

An additional visualization that would strengthen our proposal would be to look at trends in neighborhoods. Are there more rides in tourist heavy areas or are they more common in commuter routes? This could help us understand where it would be best to provide more stations. It may also be helpful to bring in more data that was weather related to determine what weather shows spikes in rides. It would be helpful to know how big of an impact weather has on rides and how it would factor into our future business.
